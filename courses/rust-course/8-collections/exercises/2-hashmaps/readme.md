# HashMaps in Rust

## Concept first: key-value storage

`HashMap<K, V>` stores mappings from keys to values and is useful for indexing and counters.

## Exercise task

1. Create a mutable `HashMap<String, i32>` called `scores`.
2. Insert `("alice", 10)` and `("bob", 20)`.
3. Read alice's score and print `alice <score>`.
