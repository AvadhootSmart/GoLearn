# Vectors in Rust

A vector (`Vec<T>`) is a common collection type in Rust that allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other in memory.

## Assignment

1. In `main`, create a new mutable vector of integers called `user_ids` using `Vec::new()`.
2. Push three IDs to the vector: `101`, `102`, and `103`.
3. Iterate over the vector and print each ID.
