# `use` Paths and Module Access

## Concept first: importing symbols for cleaner code

The `use` keyword brings paths into scope so calls are shorter and clearer.

## Exercise task

1. Keep the provided module tree.
2. Add a `use crate::server::network::connect;` line.
3. In `main`, call `connect();` and print `boot complete` afterward.
