# Functions in Rust

Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You've already seen one of the most important functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry point of many programs. You also saw the `fn` keyword, which allows you to declare new functions.

## Assignment

1. Write a function called `get_greeting` that takes no arguments and returns a `String`.
2. Inside `get_greeting`, return the string `"Welcome to Textio!"`.
3. In `main`, call `get_greeting` and print the result.
