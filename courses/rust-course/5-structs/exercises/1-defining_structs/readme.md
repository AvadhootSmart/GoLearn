# Structs in Rust

A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If you're familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an object's data attributes.

## Assignment

1. Define a struct `Message` with two fields: `body` (a `String`) and `recipient` (a `String`).
2. In `main`, instantiate a `Message` with `body` set to `"Hey there"` and `recipient` to `"555-0199"`.
3. Print the body of the message.
