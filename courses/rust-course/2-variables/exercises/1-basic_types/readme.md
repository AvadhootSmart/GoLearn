# Variables in Rust

In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once a value is bound to a name, you can't change that value. To make a variable mutable, you use the `mut` keyword.

## Assignment

1. Declare an immutable variable `server_name` and set it to `"Textio"`.
2. Declare a mutable variable `online_users` and set it to `0`.
3. Update `online_users` to `1`.
4. Print both variables (the `println!` code is provided).
